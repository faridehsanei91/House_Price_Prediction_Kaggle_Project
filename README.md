# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a Kaggle competition called [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), which provides a dataset of house features and their corresponding sale prices. The challenge is to develop predictive models that accurately estimate house prices using regression techniques.

## Running the Project

1. **Cloning the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
